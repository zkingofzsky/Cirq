        """Applies an action to the given argument, if it is a supported type.

        For example, unitary operations can implement an `_act_on_` method that
        checks if `isinstance(args, cirq.ActOnStateVectorArgs)` and, if so,
        apply their unitary effect to the state vector.

        The global `cirq.act_on` method looks for whether or not the given
        argument has this value, before attempting any fallback strategies
        specified by the argument being acted on.

        This method is analogous to python's `__imul__` in that it is expected
        to perform an inline effect if it recognizes the type of an argument,
        and return NotImplemented otherwise. It is also analogous to python's
        `__rmul__` in that dispatch is being done on the right hand side value
        instead of the left hand side value. If python had an `__rimul__`
        method, then `_act_on_` would not exist because it would be redundant.

        Args:
            args: An object of unspecified type. The method must check if this
                object is of a recognized type and act on it if so.

        Returns:
            True: The receiving object (`self`) acted on the argument.
            NotImplemented: The receiving object did not act on the argument.

            All other return values are considered to be errors.

    For example, the action may be a `cirq.Operation` and the state argument may
    represent the internal state of a state vector simulator (a
    `cirq.ActOnStateVectorArgs`).

    The action is applied by first checking if `action._act_on_` exists and
    returns `True` (instead of `NotImplemented`) for the given object. Then
    fallback strategies specified by the state argument via `_act_on_fallback_`
    are attempted. If those also fail, the method fails with a `TypeError`.

    Args:
        action: The action to apply to the state tensor. Typically a
            `cirq.Operation`.
        args: A mutable state object that should be modified by the action. May
            specify an `_act_on_fallback_` method to use in case the action
            doesn't recognize it.

            `_act_on_fallback_` method of `args`. Determines if decomposition
            should be used or avoided when attempting to act `action` on `args`.
            Used by internal methods to avoid redundant decompositions.

        Nothing. Results are communicated by editing `args`.
