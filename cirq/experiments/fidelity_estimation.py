    """Linear XEB fidelity estimator.

    Estimates fidelity from ideal probabilities of observed bitstrings.

    This estimator makes two assumptions. First, it assumes that the circuit
    used in experiment is sufficiently scrambling that its output probabilities
    follow the Porter-Thomas distribution. This assumption holds for typical
    instances of random quantum circuits of sufficient depth. Second, it assumes
    that the circuit uses enough qubits so that the Porter-Thomas distribution
    can be approximated with the exponential distribution.

    In practice the validity of these assumptions can be confirmed by plotting
    a histogram of output probabilities and comparing it to the exponential
    distribution.

    The mean of this estimator is the true fidelity f and the variance is

        (1 + 2f - f^2) / M

    where f is the fidelity and M the number of observations, equal to
    len(probabilities). This is better than logarithmic XEB (see below)
    when fidelity is f < 0.32. Since this estimator is unbiased, the
    variance is equal to the mean squared error of the estimator.

    The estimator is intended for use with xeb_fidelity() below.

    Fidelity quantifies the similarity of two quantum states. Here, we estimate

    An XEB experiment collects data from the execution of random circuits
    subject to noise. The effect of applying a random circuit with unitary U is
    modeled as U followed by a depolarizing channel. The result is that the
    initial state |ùúì‚ü© is mapped to a density matrix œÅ_U as follows:

        |ùúì‚ü© ‚Üí œÅ_U = f |ùúì_U‚ü©‚ü®ùúì_U| + (1 - f) I / D

    where |ùúì_U‚ü© = U|ùúì‚ü©, D is the dimension of the Hilbert space, I / D is the
    maximally mixed state, and f is the fidelity with which the circuit is
    applied. Let O_U be an observable that is diagonal in the computational
    basis. Then the expectation of O_U on œÅ_U is given by

        Tr(œÅ_U O_U) = f ‚ü®ùúì_U|O_U|ùúì_U‚ü© + (1 - f) Tr(O_U / D).

    This equation shows how f can be estimated, since Tr(œÅ_U O_U) can be
    estimated from experimental data, and ‚ü®ùúì_U|O_U|ùúì_U‚ü© and Tr(O_U / D) can be

    estimate of Tr(œÅ_U O_U). Then we estimate f by performing least squares
    minimization of the quantity
