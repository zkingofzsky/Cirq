# Textbook Examples

Cirq comes with a collection of example implementations of well-known quantum
algorithms that demonstrate the main features of the library.
Most of these can be found in the
[examples directory](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/tree/master/examples)
in the Github repository.

In addition to these examples, you can also find the notebooks that generated
the cirq docs found here in the
[docs directory](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/tree/master/docs) as well
as all the more advanced tutorials listed further down on this page.
